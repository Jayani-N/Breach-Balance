# Brewed Secrets (200 pts)

## Desc:

    A coffee shop stands quietly on a  street, its signage and awning visible above the entrance. The surrounding buildings and street details hint at its location. Somewhere in this scene lies the information needed to uncover the hidden flag.
    
    Flag format: bab{shopname_city}
    For example if it is Chennai Silks in Chennai it should be: bab{chennai_silks_chennai}
      
    Don't worry! The flag isn't case sensitive :)

## Solution:

    Upon uploading the image through google lens, we get to know that the cafe is in Cape Town. Upon carefully going through the list of cafes in Cape Town we find that it is called Truth       Coffee Roasting.

## Flag:
